The RL function always uses the interpolation function, even though as the function passes through the points associated with the input data, solving for the function at the associated frequencies yields the data point. This is simply for simplicity. Reference: Recent Progress in Nanomaterials for Microwave Absorption :param data: (data) Permittivity and Permeability data of Nx5 dimensions.

The raw string of a file location can also be passed as the str() argument, if utilized then the function will save the graph at the specified location. :param kwargs: :as_dataframe=: (False); True returns data in a pandas dataframe.

The effective bandwidth is the span of frequencies where the reflection loss is below some proficiency threshold (standard threshold is -10 dB). Program is computationally taxing; thus, efforts were made to push most of the computation to the C-level for faster run times - the blueprints for such are included in the cpfuncs.pyx file which is passed through pyximport().

To use libRL in RAM analysis, we can simply construct the following script in our favorite IDE to calculate, for example, the reflection loss (RL) as a unit of decibel defined as: RL(dB) = 20 \\cdot log_{10}\\Big|{\\frac{Z_{in}(f, d)-1}{Z_{in}(f, d)+1}}\\Big| RL(dB) = 20 \\cdot log_{10}\\Big|{\\frac{Z_{in}(f, d)-1}{Z_{in}(f, d)+1}}\\Big| Z_{in}(f, d) = \\Big[ \\frac{\\mu'(f) - j \\cdot \\mu''(f)}{\\epsilon'(f) - j \\cdot \\epsilon''(f)} \\Big]^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\cdot tanh \\Big( j \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi f \\cdot d}{c} \\{[\\mu'(f) - j \\cdot \\mu''(f)][\\epsilon'(f) - j \\cdot \\epsilon''(f)] \\} ^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\Big) Z_{in}(f, d) = \\Big[ \\frac{\\mu'(f) - j \\cdot \\mu''(f)}{\\epsilon'(f) - j \\cdot \\epsilon''(f)} \\Big]^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\cdot tanh \\Big( j \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi f \\cdot d}{c} \\{[\\mu'(f) - j \\cdot \\mu''(f)][\\epsilon'(f) - j \\cdot \\epsilon''(f)] \\} ^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\Big) can be calculated from the following script: import libRL results = libRL.reflection_loss( data=r'C:\\Users\\1mike\\Desktop\\paraffin_data.csv', d_set=[3.04] ) This represents the minimal computable function that libRL will calculate over. At minimum, the permittivity and permeability data should be passed, as well as the thickness parameters for calculation [this should make intuitive sense, as RL is calculated over an (f, d) grid space]. The resulting data set is a Nx3 numpy array of the Reflection Loss, frequencies, and thicknesses in columns 0, 1, 2 respectively. Of course, libRL is designed to do much more than just this minimal computation. As permittivity and permeability are farads/meter and henries/meter, the thickness parameter is decoupled from experimentation and thus can be used to calculate RL of thicknesses not explicitly used in measurement. As such, we can pass a tuple of thickness values to generate an array in accordance to numpy.arange() import libRL results = libRL.reflection_loss( data=r'C:\\Users\\1mike\\Desktop\\paraffin_data.csv', d_set=(0,5,1) ) This results in the calculation being mapped over the thickness range of 0-5 mm (libRL includes the upper bound here) at every step of 1 mm. Currently, reflection loss is being calculated using the frequency values in the permittivity and permeability data set. libRL has a protocol however which allows the user to interploate the data such that frequency can be controlled similarly to the thicknesses. import libRL results = libRL.reflection_loss( data=r'C:\\Users\\1mike\\Desktop\\paraffin_data.csv', f_set=(1,18,1), d_set=(0,5,1) ) Here, the resulting calculation returns a data set calculated over the ranges of 1-18 GHz, 0-5 mm at 1 unit intervals. To note, libRL allows for interpolation and not extrapolation . Attempts to use the interpolating functions outside of your experimental bounds throws an error.

Michael Green is a PhD candidate under the supervision of Dr. Xiaobo Chen at the University of Missouri–Kansas City,
Department of Chemistry. He received his Bachelors of Science in chemistry with a minor in mathematics from the
University of Idaho in 2016, and his Masters of Science in chemistry from the University of Missouri–Kansas City in 2019.
His research interests include the development, characterization, modeling, and application of nanomaterials in
light/matter interactions, focusing on photolysis, photocatalysis, and microwave absorption, as well as 
short-range matter/matter interactions with a focus in physical adsorption.

Dr. Xiaobo Chen is an Associate Professor at the University of Missouri–Kansas City, Department of Chemistry. 
His research interests include nanomaterials, catalysis, electrochemistry, light-materials interactions and 
their applications in renewable energy, environment protection, and information protection through microwave 
absorption. His renowned work includes the discovery of black TiO2 with Professor Samuel S. Mao at the 
University of California, Berkeley and the new application of black TiO2 nanomaterials along with other nanomaterials 
in microwave absorption application.
